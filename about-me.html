                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised by a single mother in the small town of Mahikeng in the North West province.</p>
                <p>I have always worked hard and achieved good grades throughout my schooling.</p>
                <p>I was also good in sports and in high school, I was part of the cricket team, football team as well as the chess team.</p>
                <p>I was taught good values and principles that sustain me to this day.</p>

        <div class="separate-about-me-section-sub-section career">
            <div>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>Having obtained my BSc in Physics as well as my BSc in Engineering qualifications from Wits, I started my professional career at Schindler Lifts as a graduate engineer.</p>
                <p>I was part of Schindler Lifts for 5 years until the end of my employment in 2020 primarily due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
                <p>Due to my passion in tutoring, I then formed a tutoring company called GreatMindz Tutors while deciding what to do with my professional career.</p>
                <p>In late 2022, I made a decision to switch careers from Engineering to Software Development and started teaching myself how to program.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Tutoring</h2>
                <p>I started tutoring in 2015 when I was still a graduate engineer at Schindler Lifts with just a single learner.</p>                
                <p>As time went by, I actually realised that I enjoy tutoring and went on to tutor more learners.</p>
                <p>At the time, I was primarily providing one-on-one face-to-face lessons at the learners'homes. </p>
                <p>I have been a part of various tutoring companies such as Teach Me 2, BrightSparks and Turtlejar.</p>
               
                <p>I have been tutoring learners with different learning abilities and different backgrounds ever since I started 
                    and have made a difference in their academic performance. I have helped learners achieve distinctions and others
                     get pass grades from failing grades.
                </p>
                <p>I have great understanding of the subject matter and this enables me to simplify concepts greatly. 
                    I am very patient and will take time to explain concepts until a learner understands completely.
                    My lessons involve in-lesson exercises and homework exercises to strengthen and solidify concepts learnt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am highly professional. I attend lessons on time and in cases where I cannot attend lessons, I communicate this
                    promptly to the learner or the parent. I am highly reliable and consistent and will treat your child's success
                    as if it were my own.

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I enjoy jogging in my spare time to keep healthy and stay energised.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy watching sports as I am big football fan and a big Kaizer Chiefs fan (I know!)</p>
                <p>Dancing also makes me happy and I like to move my body from time to time.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading and learning new things. Currently, I am looking to establish a solid career
                    as a software developer and therefore I am always reading about the latest news in technology, 
                    programming and artificial intelligence.
