                        Tebogo is a very well-spoken and patient tutor. He takes his time when explaining and does not get
                        frustrated when having to repeat himself. He is respectful and sets his students at ease.
                        He is easy to approach with questions and uses easier methods of explaining to help students 
                        understand different topics.

                        My name is Christo Kotze. My daughter received additional classes for Grade 11 Physical Science from Mr. Mosiane
                        in 2023. She is now in Grade 12 and we are still making use of his service because of the excellent service rendered.
                        Because of this and the very good results my daughter achieved, we also enrolled our son who is in Grade 10 for
                        additional classes with Mr. Mosiane.Us as parents and our children are very satisfied with the service we receive 
                        and will highly recommend Mr. Mosiane for this.
